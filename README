DESCRIPTION
===========================================
This project is an music player app built in the Python programming language. It currently uses 
the following libraries/modules:

- Python 2.7
- wxPython 3.0
- ObjectListView
- eyeD3

The project is incomplete as of yet, but basic media player functionality is present. It uses 
the MediaCtrl control supplied by wxPython to power the music player, which in turn is powered
by DirectShow on Windows.

Although cross-platform compatibility is possible in theory, as the only thing keeping it from 
working is to change the backend argument in the MediaCtrl constructor, I've decided it'd be 
best for now to stick Windows-only, as I lack the capability to test and develop on Mac/Linux
systems.

===========================================
USAGE
===========================================
1. Click on the "Load Files?" button.
2. Select one or more music files. Its been tested with MP3 files, but the exact extent of the
backend's support is unknown. I'm assuming that any music file you can currently play on your
PC, regardless of player, can be played here. I have yet to test other file formats like .ogg
or .wma.
3. Once you've hit the OK button, the list at the bottom of the screen will be populated.
4. Double click on any item in the list to load the file for playing.
5. Click 'play'.
6. Enjoy!

ISSUES
===========================================
This project is still in development, so I'm finding new (broken) things every day. Here's what
I've found so far:

- (fixed) loading a new group of files from the "Load Files" dialog will erase and repopulate the list
rather than just 'appending' it. I intend to change this in the future.
