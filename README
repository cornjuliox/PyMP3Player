===========================================
USAGE
===========================================
1. Click on File->Load Files. 
2. Select one or more music files. Its been tested with MP3 files, but the exact extent of the
backend's support is unknown. I'm assuming that any music file you can currently play on your
PC, regardless of player, can be played here. I have yet to test other file formats like .ogg
or .wma.
5. Click 'play' if it hasn't started playing.
6. Enjoy!

ISSUES
===========================================
This project is still in development, so I'm finding new (broken) things every day. Here's what
I've found so far:

- (fixed) loading a new group of files from the "Load Files" dialog will erase and repopulate the list
rather than just 'appending' it. I intend to change this in the future.
